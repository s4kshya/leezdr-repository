INTRODUCTION TO COSTAR
======================
Costar is a software cost estimation tool based on the Constructive Cost
Model (COCOMO) described by Dr. Barry Boehm in his books "Software
Engineering Economics" and "Software Cost Estimation with COCOMO II".

Software project managers use Costar to produce estimates of a project's
duration, staffing levels, and cost.  Costar permits you to make trade-offs
and experiment with "what-if" analyses to arrive at the optimal project plan.

Costar supports COCOMO II, COCOMO 81, REVIC, Ada COCOMO, and Incremental COCOMO.

Costar 7.0 runs under Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT 4, Windows 2000,
and Windows XP.


INTRODUCTION TO COCOMO

COSTAR INSTALLATION
===================
If your copy of Costar came on a CD, the installation procedure will
start automatically when you insert the CD.

If you were sent the file "costar7.exe", just double-click it to start
the installation.

If you've purchased a Site License or Corporate License for Costar, you
may distribute the file "costar7.exe" to your employees (e.g. by e-mail).


WHAT'S NEW IN COSTAR 7.0
========================
1)  Costar launches a wizard when it starts.  The wizard helps you set
    Scale Drivers, Cost Drivers, etc.

2)  The two main windows of Costar 6.0 have been merged into a single window.

3)  Several new reports have been added:
	Equations Report
	Cost Driver Report
	Effort Report
	Cost Report
	Size Summary

4)  Costar supports Drag & Drop.

5)  The GUI is simpler and more powerful.  New features include:

	Effort may be displayed in either Person-Months or Person-Hours.
	You may select an option to display effort with extra precision.

	The main window is customizable, with 7 optional sections:
		Estimate Toolbar
		Component Toolbar
		Report Toolbar
		Estimation Results
		Titles
		Hint Bar
		Status Bar

	The EAF has been made more visible -- it's on the new Cost Driver
	Report, and on the Status Bar.

	Productivity has been made more visible -- it's in the Estimation
	Results section of the main window.
	
6)  Filters have been added, as a way to post-process the COCOMO results.
    Check the help message for several examples.

7)  Costar 7.0 can import files from the USC tool.


RELEASE NOTES
=============
1)  It's easy to upgrade from Costar 6.0 to Costar 7.0.  Simply run
    Costar 7.0, and read your files created by Costar 6.0 (i.e. Costar 7.0
    can read them with no translation required).  When Costar 7.0
    is about to overwrite an estimate file created by Costar 6.0, it will
    rename the old file using the "cv6" extension (e.g. from "sample.cst"
    to "sample.cv6").

2)  The Costar Window describes the "current estimate".  You can create
    other estimates with "New | Estimate".

3)  Press Control-P to print any window on the printer.

4)  You can write an Excel macro that takes data from cells in a spreadsheet,
    sends the data as inputs to Costar, and then extracts answers from the
    Costar reports to be displayed in your spreadsheet.

    Call us at (603) 672-0987 if you want more information on this topic.

5)  Calico 7.0 includes the ability to edit all of the parameters
    that make up a COCOMO estimating model, including:
	a) The model's effort & schedule distributions
	b) The cost drivers
	c) The effort multipliers
	d) The names of the phases and activities

    Calico 7.0 also calibrates the COCOMO equation to your historical data.

    After you use Calico to create a *.mdl file, you can use Costar's
    File | Load Model to use your new model for estimating.

6)  Differences between 7.00 and 7.01.

    	a) In Costar 7.01, the "Show this Wizard the next time Costar starts"
	   checkbox in the Create Estimate Wizard is checked by default.

7)  Differences between 7.01 and 7.02.

    	a) A defect in the Constrain Project dialog has been corrected.
	   Clicking the Apply button issued the correct command,
	   but displayed incorrect results in the dialog box.
